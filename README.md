# Customer Booking Prediction for British Airways Using Random Forest
The goal of this project is to explore, preprocess, and analyze a customer dataset to develop a predictive model that forecasts customer booking behavior. The main aim is to predict the probability of a customer making a booking based on various features provided in the dataset. In the initial exploration phase, the dataset will be carefully analyzed to understand its structure, identify key variables, and derive basic statistics. During the data preparation stage, additional features may be created to enhance the model’s ability to make accurate predictions. After preparing the data, a machine learning model will be trained, focusing on algorithms that offer transparency in understanding how each feature contributes to the model’s predictions, such as Random Forest. The model’s effectiveness will be evaluated using cross-validation, with appropriate performance metrics to assess its accuracy and predictive capabilities. Ultimately, this project aims to generate actionable insights into customer behavior, which can inform marketing strategies and help in targeting customers more effectively.
